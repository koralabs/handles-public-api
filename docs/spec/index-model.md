# Index and Data Model Spec

## Overview
`HandlesRepository` is the canonical read/write domain layer over the Valkey-backed `RedisHandlesStore`. Scanner paths write ordered chain state into indexes; API paths read from those indexes without chain RPC calls on request paths.

## Primary Index Domains

### Core Handle State
- `HANDLE`: hash map keyed by handle name containing canonical stored handle fields.
- `SLOT`: ordered set from slot to handle names for slot-based pagination.
- `MINT`: set of serialized minting records per handle. Members are encoded with a canonical JSON stringifier (`canonicalJsonStringify`) that sorts object keys recursively and coerces `bigint` to a numeric string, so replaying a block after a mid-block Lambda crash produces a byte-identical set member and SADD deduplicates instead of creating a second entry.

### Ownership and Resolution
- `HOLDER`: set of handles per holder key.
- `DEFAULT_HANDLE`: optional explicit default-handle set per holder.
- `HOLDER_COUNT`: ordered set for holder ranking/pagination.
- `ADDRESS`, `PAYMENT_KEY_HASH`, `HASH_OF_STAKE_KEY_HASH`: reverse lookup indexes for resolved addresses and key hashes.

### Search Facets
- `RARITY`, `LENGTH`, `CHARACTER`, `NUMERIC_MODIFIER`, `HANDLE_TYPE`, `OG`, `PERSONALIZED`.
- Search queries are set intersections over active filters, then optional text/hex matching and pagination.

### Subhandle and UTxO History
- `SUBHANDLE`: root-handle to child-subhandle mapping.
- `UTXO_SLOT`: ordered set mapping slot to UTxO IDs.
- `UTXO`: hash map keyed by UTxO ID storing normalized UTxO records.

## Write Flow
1. Scanner retrieves ordered block/tx payloads and normalizes minting data.
2. `addMintDataFromUTxOs` persists mint records once per batch.
3. `addUTxOsWithMintDataAndUpdateIndexes` stores UTxOs and calls `updateHandleIndexes`.
4. `updateHandleIndexes` mutates handle records, owner indexes, personalization/subhandle projections, and slot indexes.
   - When a UTxO contains a reference token (`LBL_100`) or sub-handle settings token (`LBL_001`) whose inline datum is missing, the processor logs an error and `continue`s to the next asset in the same UTxO instead of returning from the function. This preserves state for co-minted/co-transferred handles that would otherwise be silently abandoned.
   - `updateHandleIndexes` accepts an optional `options.suppressDoubleMintDetection` flag. Rollback/drift repair paths set it to `true` because `stored.utxo !== canonical.utxo` is a tautology during repair — running the normal double-mint branch would falsely bump `handle.amount` on every repair cycle and eventually cause `removeHandle`'s `amount - 1 <= 0` burn threshold to stop firing on affected handles.

### Per-handle index symmetry
- `save(handle, oldHandle?)` writes to `HANDLE_TYPE`, both `PERSONALIZED` buckets, and the `SLOT` ZSET; `removeHandle(handle)` on a full burn must prune every one of them or searches filtered by those indexes return keys that no longer exist in `HANDLE`.
- `save()` removes the old `HANDLE_TYPE` bucket entry when `oldHandle.handle_type !== handle.handle_type` (e.g., `HANDLE` → `VIRTUAL_SUBHANDLE` on an LBL_000 update), so a type transition does not leave an orphan in the prior bucket.
- `save()` cleans `SLOT` by handle name (`ZREM slot name`). The prior code called `removeValuesFromOrderedSet(SLOT, updated_slot_number)`, which stringified the ordinal and performed a no-op `ZREM` in almost every case — worst case a wrong-target removal for a handle whose name happened to equal the current block slot.
- `removeHandle` removes the burned handle from both `PERSONALIZED:0` and `PERSONALIZED:1`. Recomputing the current bucket (`image_hash != standard_image_hash` OR any populated `personalization` field) could disagree with what `save()` actually wrote for legacy or drifted state, so cleanup is defensive by design — `SREM` on the wrong bucket is a no-op.
- The `PERSONALIZED` bucket predicate lives in one place — `utils/isPersonalized.ts` (`isHandlePersonalized`) — and is reused by `save()` and by the API's `is_personalized` view-model field, so the `?personalized=` filter and the per-handle field can never disagree. **`is_personalized` (state: personalization has *been applied*) is distinct from `pz_enabled` (capability: personalization is *allowed*).** It is true for any applied personalization type: a non-standard rendered image or set `bg_image`/`pfp_image`/`bg_asset`/`pfp_asset`; `designer`/`portal`/`socials`(URLs) content; or custom resolved chain addresses (any `resolved_addresses` key beyond the auto-resolved `ada`). Creator/partner-applied defaults count because they populate these same fields. See Discord ticket #1958 / api.handle.me#199.
  - **Reindex note:** the per-handle `is_personalized` field is derived on read, so it is correct immediately for all handles. The `?personalized=` *filter* reads the `PERSONALIZED` index, which is (re)written by `save()`; this predicate was broadened (it previously bucketed on image/designer/portal/socials only — missing custom chain addresses and explicit bg/pfp assets), so existing handles only re-bucket the next time they're saved. A reindex pass is required for the filter to reflect the broadened predicate across all already-stored handles.

## Read Flow
1. Route/controller parses request query/path models.
2. Repository resolves index sets and intersections for filters.
3. Repository hydrates stored handle objects and default-handle projection.
4. Controller serializes output shape for JSON or text responses.

## Key Namespace
All index keys are scoped under `{api:<network>}:<IndexName>` (e.g., `{api:mainnet}:HANDLE`). Additional operational keys outside the index domains:
- `scanner:lease` — expiring SET NX lease for scanner concurrency
- `scanner:recovery` — recovery flag for mid-phase interruption (`rollback` or `reindex`)
- `mpt_root_hash` — cached MPT root computed from the current handle set
- `scanned_blocks` — sorted set (score = slot, value = block hash) of every block the scanner has processed, including blocks that carried zero handle txs. `processRollback` relies on this ledger to distinguish "blocks canonical has that we genuinely missed" from "blocks we correctly scanned but stored nothing for because they had no handle activity." Deriving this from stored UTxO blockHashes would false-positive every handle-free canonical block as missed. Populated per-block inside `scan()` via `recordScannedBlock`, trimmed to the most recent 3000 entries (~16 hours of chain time) after each scan chunk loop, and restored in bulk from S3 snapshots during reimport.

## Consistency Invariants
- Scanner/index writes are synchronous by block/UTxO ordering.
- Missing minting data during update is a hard error (scanner invariant protection).
- Holder indexes and holder-count ranking update together.
- Pipeline execution always clears queued state on failure. Reentrant `RedisHandlesStore.pipeline()` calls throw — the previous behavior silently overwrote the outer queue's commands, which was a silent data-loss path.
- Rollback/reindex flows clear lock state in `finally` paths to prevent deadlocks.
- Stored `mpt_root_hash` must reflect the `IndexNames.HANDLE` key set at `metrics.currentSlot`. The scanner `scan()` rebuilds it in a `finally`, guarded by an `endingCurrentSlot !== startingCurrentSlot` check, so every exit path — including `ScannerDeadlineError`, retriable Koios/Blockfrost failures, and fatal rethrown errors — leaves the stored root in sync with the handle set. No-op invocations (no blocks processed) skip the rebuild.
- Scanner lease (`scanner:lease`) renew and release operate via atomic Lua CAS — a GET-then-PEXPIRE/DEL round trip opened a TOCTOU window where a stale owner could extend a freshly-reacquired lease belonging to another invocation.
- `IndexNames.MINT` members must be canonically stringified. Non-canonical JSON encoding could produce two distinct set members for the same logical mint across a block replay (e.g., when the provider returns the same mint's metadata with different key insertion order), creating a phantom duplicate.
- The snapshot-loader progress marker (`{api:NETWORK}:snapshot_loader:progress`) is tagged with `utxoSchemaVersion` and `snapshotHash`. Resuming an interrupted snapshot import is only valid against the exact snapshot bytes the marker was written for — a schema bump or operator-uploaded replacement snapshot across invocations triggers a `clearNamespace` and fresh start rather than applying stale chunk offsets to new-schema data.

## Snapshot and Schema Behavior
- Snapshot population can bootstrap UTxOs and minting data from S3 snapshot artifacts.
- Snapshot artifacts are only considered valid when they carry chain-verification metadata from generation time; verification compares the indexed handle set to the indexed `handle_root@handle_settings` datum root hash, and unverified artifacts are ignored at bootstrap.
- Snapshot artifacts also carry an optional `scannedBlocks` field (`{ slot, hash }[]` filtered to `<= lastSlot` at write time). On S3 reimport the scanner populates the `scanned_blocks` ZSET in bulk from this field before forward scanning resumes, so rollback-check drift detection is accurate immediately after reimport instead of having to rebuild the ledger through forward scanning. Snapshots published before this field existed simply skip the restore; the ledger gets repopulated as the scanner processes blocks forward.
- `indexSchemaVersion` and `utxoSchemaVersion` metrics control reindex/bootstrap decisions at startup.
- Reindex repopulates all non-UTxO/non-MINT indexes from stored UTxOs. `scanned_blocks` is preserved across reindex because it lives outside `IndexNames` — it tracks blocks-we-have-seen rather than derived-from-UTxOs state, and cannot be reconstructed from stored UTxOs (most canonical blocks carry no handle activity and therefore contribute no stored UTxO).
